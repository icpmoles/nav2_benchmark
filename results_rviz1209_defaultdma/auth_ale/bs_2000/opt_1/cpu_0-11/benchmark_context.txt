[ERROR] [1765278086.696719014] [computeCircumscribedCost]: The inflation radius (0.550000) is smaller than the circumscribed radius (1.145513) If this is an SE2-collision checking plugin, it cannot use costmap potential field to speed up collision checking by only checking the full footprint when robot is within possibly-inscribed radius of an obstacle. This may significantly slow down planning times!
[ERROR] [1765278086.696729041] [dummy]: Inflation layer either not found or inflation is not set sufficiently for optimized non-circular collision checking capabilities. It is HIGHLY recommended to set the inflation radius to be at MINIMUM half of the robot's largest cross-section. See github.com/ros-planning/navigation2/tree/main/nav2_smac_planner#potential-fields for full instructions. This will substantially impact run-time performance.
