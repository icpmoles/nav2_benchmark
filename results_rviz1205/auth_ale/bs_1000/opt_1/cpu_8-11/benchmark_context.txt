[ERROR] [1764951512.391047535] [computeCircumscribedCost]: The inflation radius (0.550000) is smaller than the circumscribed radius (1.145513) If this is an SE2-collision checking plugin, it cannot use costmap potential field to speed up collision checking by only checking the full footprint when robot is within possibly-inscribed radius of an obstacle. This may significantly slow down planning times!
